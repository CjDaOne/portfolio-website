# Portfolio Website Modernization Project - Team Guide

## Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing portfolio website into a modern, responsive, and visually appealing site. The site is currently based on the HTML5UP Dimension template and needs updates to contemporary web standards and design trends.

## Team Structure
- **Managing Engineer**: Oversees the entire project, assigns tasks to subagents, ensures quality control, and maintains project documentation.
- **Subagents**: Specialized agents created by the Managing Engineer to handle specific tasks such as front-end development, styling, content management, and testing.

## Roles and Responsibilities
### Managing Engineer
- Create and manage subagent teams for different aspects of the project
- Define project milestones and deadlines
- Review code changes and ensure adherence to standards
- Coordinate between different subagents
- Maintain this team guide and project documentation

### Subagents
- Execute assigned tasks efficiently
- Follow established coding standards and best practices
- Communicate progress and issues to the Managing Engineer
- Collaborate with other subagents when needed

## Best Practices and Standards

### Code Quality
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Write clean, readable CSS with proper naming conventions (BEM methodology preferred)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### Version Control
- Use Git for version control
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow the format: `type: description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Branch naming: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Ensure fast loading times

### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Use proper alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Use flexible layouts (flexbox/grid)
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
- Analyze current site structure
- Identify modernization requirements
- Create detailed task breakdown

### Phase 2: Design Updates
- Update visual design to modern standards
- Implement responsive layouts
- Add modern UI elements (animations, transitions)

### Phase 3: Content and Functionality
- Review and update content
- Add interactive features if needed
- Optimize for performance

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance optimization
- Deploy to production

## Communication Protocol
- All subagents report progress to the Managing Engineer
- Use this document for task assignment and status updates
- Escalate issues immediately to the Managing Engineer

## Tools and Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git for version control
- Responsive design frameworks (consider Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS)
- Build tools as needed (e.g., for minification)

## Quality Assurance
- Code reviews by Managing Engineer
- Automated testing where applicable
- Manual testing across devices and browsers
- Performance benchmarking

## Documentation
- Update this guide as the project evolves
- Maintain separate technical documentation for code changes
- Document any custom tools or scripts created

## Success Metrics
- Improved loading speed
- Better mobile experience
- Enhanced accessibility scores
- Positive user feedback
